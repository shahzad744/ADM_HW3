Our cabin is cozy with all the amenities (volleyball, grill &amp; hammock!), and good for couples, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets). Covered porch is awesome.	32.3037973947059	-96.1046528596618	Cozy Cedar Creek Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14315306?location=Cedar%20Creek%20Reservoir%2C%20TX
