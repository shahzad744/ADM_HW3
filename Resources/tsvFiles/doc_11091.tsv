Great restaurants &amp; shopping minutes from the house. \n\nAccess to the kitchen &amp; your own private bath. Parking included. Great place to escape all the noise &amp; traffic that downtown has but yet still a short drive to several spots. \n\nRecently engaged couple hoping to meet travelers from all over! We are always down for a fun time, but obviously have full time jobs &amp; ask that you respect that \n\nBook now!	30.4985664138258	-97.8391203250941	Spacious home outside ACL	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19230036?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
