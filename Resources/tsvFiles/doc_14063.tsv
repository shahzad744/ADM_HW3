14063	$548	3	League City	February 2013	My place is just outside of Houston, 28 miles to NRG stadium, and reasonably priced. You'll want to Uber to Superbowl, parties, and bars anyway, no matter where you stay. Better yet, I will drive you to and from the game and parties if you like!!! Youâ€™ll love my place because of the beautiful soft light, spacious rooms, relaxing pool, and hot tub. Pet friendly!	29.4836498631374	-95.160698512072	Superbowl Suburban Retreat 2017 Houston	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16828127?location=Baytown%2C%20TX
