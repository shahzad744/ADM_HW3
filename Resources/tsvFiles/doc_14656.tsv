14656	$102	1	Austin	October 2013	Quiet, top-floor corner unit walking distance to the Convention Center, S. Congress, and downtown (SXSW). Right on the Town Lake trail &amp; walking distance to Zilker Park. Enjoy hanging on the rooftop with an amazing view of downtown. Tons of natural light with blackout curtains in the bedroom for good sleep.\n\nAcross the street from my favorite breakfast tacos in town and next door to an organic, fair-trade coffee shop. I use organic detergents for all linens, and hand soaps are organic as well.	30.2563293185139	-97.7464553061556	Downtown-Walk Everywhere!
