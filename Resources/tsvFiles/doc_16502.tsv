16502	$352	3	Surfside Beach	May 2015	My house is close to the beach, great views, and restaurants and dining. You’ll love it because of the views, the location, the ambiance, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets).\n\nComfortably sleeps 10 people. Open floor plan, beach themed decorations, over sized balconies with beautiful views of the ocean. The beach is just steps from the house and very safe without having to cross any roads.	28.9691337883619	-95.268177794608	Surfside paradise #2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17346401?location=Angleton%2C%20TX
