1681	$110	2	Bellaire	June 2010	Duplex with lots of natural light and a great yard in safe and central neighborhood. \nPerfect for medical center and Galeria visitors. Close to downtown, Rice and Museum district. Great restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance.\nNote: This place becomes available as an AirBnb instead of a long term rental in June so the pictures do not have the brand new furniture that we have purchased for it. Until the pictures are up, the prices are low so enjoy a discount and brand new stuff!	29.7157112532209	-95.4517283864766	Bright House with a large yard	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17575076?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
