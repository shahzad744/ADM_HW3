1715	$129	3	San Antonio	May 2011	Cute three bedroom house in Alamo Heights area (AHISD). It is near the Quarry and Northstar Mall for shopping, and close to the Airport and the Zoo. \n\nIt has two full baths, including one in the master bedroom. We put in a nice deck and table in the backyard making it great on nice evenings (or days if Texas is not too hot). The neighborhood and the street are also quiet.\n\nWe have also installed a new kitchen and updated the baths. \n\nThis is the house my family stays in when we visit relatives, so we hope that it makes others feel at home.\n\nThis house is well suited for 6 people, however, if you have a larger party, please contact us beforehand.\n\nPlease no parties and no pets.	29.5031810130356	-98.4689388767949	Cute House in Alamo Heights Area	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/109393?location=Converse%2C%20TX
