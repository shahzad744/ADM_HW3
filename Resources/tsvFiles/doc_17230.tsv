17230	$32	1	Frisco	July 2014	My house is close to a baseball stadium , grocery store, Starbucks, a mall, dining, nightclubs etc. Youâ€™ll enjoy my place because it's quiet, clean and safe. This AirBnb home is good for mom/daughter trips, solo adventurers, and business travelers but no pets nor small children. \n For travelers that travel by two, I have two rooms available. I do charge for each room but the convenience is there for you. My dog Elli is waiting. Please write with any questions! Happy travels!	33.1444341243289	-96.7725397739537	Cozy and quiet	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13865333?location=Anna%2C%20TX
