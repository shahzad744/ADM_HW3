17786	$50	1	Fort Worth	June 2015	My place is close to nightlife, the city center, museums, dining, shopping. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the kitchen, the high ceilings, walking distance to everything.\n\nAgain, there's a lot of things to do around here and everything is in walking distance! This is a really upscale area and has a lot of security as well! The neighbors are pretty quiet and the walls are pretty good too.	32.7526317797733	-97.3651909608611	BEAUTIFUL, modern 1bd/1ba Apt on West 7th street!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13754582?location=Azle%2C%20TX
