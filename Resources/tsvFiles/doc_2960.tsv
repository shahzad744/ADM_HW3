2960	$79	1	The Woodlands	May 2016	My place is like a retreat. It is quiet and serene. A woodland view outside every window. Great for business trips, runners, cyclists, walkers, nature lovers, anyone looking for a private quiet stay. Therapeutic massage/bodywork by licensed therapist is additional option. Special diet options on request. It is close to shopping, nightlife, water (lake) activities, public transport, major hospitals and Houston Intercontinental Airport. Youâ€™ll love my place.	30.2360587710583	-95.5916553759051	Woodlands Serenity Retreat	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13116765?location=Conroe%2C%20TX
