3130	$175	2	Austin	November 2012	Welcome to my cedar cabin in the city. This very eclectic house has personality where lone travelers can escape or families can bring their kiddos. Careful not to keep the back door open or the free range chickens might sneak in!\n\nLocated in Brentwood, it is just 2 miles from downtown and less than a block from the bus stop.	30.3216770502511	-97.7378381326896	The Coffey Grounds	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/765450?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
