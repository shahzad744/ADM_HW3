5114	$225	2	Ledbetter	March 2015	This charming farmhouse is a place to get away from the hustle of the city. It sits on a 100+ acre portion of our ranch with barns, fenced fields and plenty of paths for hiking. It is amazingly secluded, but is still accessible to the rural Texas attractions surrounding Roundtop.	30.1190039336596	-96.8202541465834	1920 farmhouse near Round Top Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8867501?location=Carmine%2C%20TX
