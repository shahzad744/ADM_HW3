86	$35	1	Houston	January 2016	Hi! Our house is tucked away at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and is 20 minute easy drive to Houston Intercontinental Airport. We have easy access to Kingwood's great greenbelts for walking and running. We are a busy family with two kids and three wonderful dogs, but our house is your house when you stay with us! You'll have your own private bedroom (upstairs) and a full bath (downstairs). A second private bedroom with an air mattress is available for larger parties.	30.0368357226539	-95.2260877666175	Comfortable Family Home near IAH	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14555472?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
