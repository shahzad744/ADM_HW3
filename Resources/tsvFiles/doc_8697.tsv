There is a queen size bed, TV with cable, Air conditioner / heater, mini fridge &amp; a coffee maker (along with use of a grill and patio).\nThe room is not huge but it is nice and cozy and has everything anyone would need for a short term stay (1 day to 1 week).\nThe apartment is located in a vibrant historic neighborhood\njust one mile from Fort Worth museums (Modern, Amon Carter, Kimbell, Science &amp; History) and the Will Rogers Coliseum (Rodeo). It is also close to West 7th (new restaurants, bars, shopping) and walking distance to a wine bar (Winslow's) and Gingerman (beer pub) among other things. It's about 3 miles from Downtown Fort Worth (Sundance Square, etc).\nThere is a two car driveway so there's a parking spot (or more if needed) right in front of the apartment.\nThere is a park and community center (with gym) 1/2 block away and a school with a track, basketball courts and exercise circuit 1/2 block away. \nPublic transportation is close, with a bus stop 2 blocks away, and we'd be happy to lend a bicycle to anyone looking to check out the area on bike.\n\n\nFeel free to lay on the hammock in the backyard, sit on the back porch, use the grill or anything else in the backyard.\nIf you need a garage parking spot, we can try to accommodate.\n\nWe love interacting with guests when we're around and if guests are in the mood to talk. \nWe respect our guests space and understand if guests prefer to just enjoy the peace and quiet.\n\nOur neighborhood is very friendly and active and when the weather is comfortable, there are lots of folks walking, exercising, playing at the park and socializing.\nMost homes were built in the 1920's - 1930's and have been renovated. \nWe are close to shopping and restaurants, although there are only a few within short walking distance.\n\nThere is a bus stop 2 blocks away which can quickly take you to the museums or downtown. \nIf you have a car, feel free to park in our driveway or on the street.\nFrom the airport, our place is about a 45 minute drive.
