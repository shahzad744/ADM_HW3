8944	$50	2	Allen	October 2012	My home is close to many great restaurants, shopping and Parks. I am minutes from the Allen Outlet Mall and the Allen Event Center. My home is perfect for those on vacation and business travelers. You'll love the easy access to freeways and getting to surrounding areas. I enjoy traveling and meeting people from all over. I do have a cat in the house, but chances are you will never see her!	33.1044047089666	-96.6951208201751	Home Away From Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18275553?location=Celina%2C%20TX
