Breakfast is provided by way of oatmeal and any items found on the counter (Hot tea and coffee too). \n\nFour-Legged Friends: \nI do have two wonderful dogs (lab and husky), but don't worry they aren't allowed upstairs. They stay outside during the day, and sleep in their beds downstairs at night. They are both full of sugar - but if you have a fear of dogs then this place is not for you(URL HIDDEN)\nLocation:\nIt is literally right next to a brand new grocery store but you wouldn't know it from the back yard. It is 10-15 minutes from La Cantera - the gorgeous outdoor shopping mall. As well as Six Flags Fiesta Texas and UTSA. It is 5-10 minutes from the medical center area where all the hospitals are.
